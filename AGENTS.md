This is a Rust project.

It uses Hermit for managing tools/utilities.

The script ./scripts/lhm is a convenience script that compiles and executes proctor. ALWAYS use this to run, NEVER
manually compile and run.

Check the libraries already added in @Cargo.toml. Always use the `cargo` CLI rather than editing Cargo.toml directly.

@README.md describes the design of this command-line tool.

ALWAYS keep the README up to date with features.
